---

## 🧠 Overview
Developed a robust machine learning pipeline to classify the presence of the P-wave in ECG signals using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The model plays a critical role in detecting arrhythmic events for early cardiac diagnosis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
- SMOTE, Z-score normalization, PCA
- Feature engineering (RR intervals, frequency domain, statistical descriptors)

## 🔍 Key Contributions
- Achieved 92.14% accuracy with Random Forest after hyperparameter tuning.
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE, boosting recall to 95.55%.
- Conducted advanced feature engineering and signal segmentation.
- Applied statistical analysis for model evaluation (precision, recall, F1).

## 🌍 Real-World Impact
Automates early detection of heart arrhythmias through non-invasive ECG signals, enabling scalable and low-cost diagnostic support in clinical settings.
