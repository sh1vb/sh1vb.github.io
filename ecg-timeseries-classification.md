permalink: /projects/ecg-timeseries-classification/
---

## 🧠 Overview
Designed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to classify arrhythmia types using time-series ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
- Min-Max scaling, Sliding Window Segmentation
- Feature extraction (amplitudes, RR intervals, local maxima, PSD)

## 🔍 Key Contributions
- Achieved 90.6% accuracy with Random Forest after Randomized Search CV.
- Extracted heartbeat-level ECG features for arrhythmia classification.
- Improved minority class performance using SMOTE and class balancing.
- Built multiclass classifiers to distinguish between 15 arrhythmia types.

## 🌍 Real-World Impact
Supports cardiologists in detecting and classifying heart rhythm disorders, streamlining diagnostics and reducing dependency on manual ECG interpretation.
