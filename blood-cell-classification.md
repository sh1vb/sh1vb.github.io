## üß† Overview
Engineered a hybrid deep learning model to classify blood cells into multiple types using microscopy images. Developed for scalable diagnostic support in resource-constrained healthcare systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- CNN, ResNet-50, Xception, InceptionV3, U-Net, VGG16
- Supervised Contrastive Learning
- SMOTE, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- Stratified sampling, Image augmentation, Ensemble models

## üîç Key Contributions
- Achieved 98.51% test accuracy using a hybrid InceptionV3-Xception model.
- Developed and compared 11 deep learning architectures with stratified cross-validation.
- Applied advanced techniques like SMOTE and contrastive learning to improve class balance and generalization.
- Created automated image classification pipelines using clinical datasets from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.

## üåç Real-World Impact
Enhances diagnostic precision for blood disorders, reduces dependence on manual smear evaluations, and brings AI-driven pathology within reach of underserved areas.
